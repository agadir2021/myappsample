git status actually shows you information about your working tree
 (still often called working directory back then), your staging area
 (also called index) and your actual commits.  There are three separate
 things to compare.  "Nothing to commit, working directory clean" means that you 1.
 have no un-staged changes, 2. you have no staged changes.
